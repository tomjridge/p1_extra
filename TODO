(latest at the end of following list)

- use dsl with earley parser
- a dsl without actions, or with multiple (configurable)
  actions... but perhaps we just pass in the actions as functions
- add memoization to parsing_dsl2 (should make performance bearable at
  least for small inputs)
- think more about how to integrate state (memo etc) with p1_core
  (especially let rec, where memo hashtables need to be created
  outside the let rec; but we can index on the nonterm to locate the
  memo table)
- add the optimization that, on first parsing a nt at posn i, clears
  the context then reuses this memoizaed result for all future parses
